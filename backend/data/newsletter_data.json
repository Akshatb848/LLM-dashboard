    "message": "Dear Colleagues and Stakeholders,\n\nIt gives me immense pleasure to present this comprehensive newsletter showcasing the remarkable progress in India's education sector. Our journey from April 2025 to January 2026 has been marked by unprecedented achievements in digital infrastructure, student enrollment, and learning outcomes.\n\nThe APAAR (Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry) initiative has crossed 230 million registrations, establishing a robust foundation for personalized learning and seamless academic progression. Our National Education Dashboard has emerged as a cornerstone for data-driven decision-making, enabling real-time monitoring across 950,000+ schools.\n\nI commend all state departments, educators, and technology partners for their unwavering commitment to educational excellence. Together, we are building an inclusive, equitable, and quality education system for every child in India.\n\nWith warm regards,\nDr. Rajesh Kumar"
