RVSK / VSK Platform – UI Corrections, Stat Consistency & Chatbot Accuracy

System Role
You are a senior full-stack + LLM engineer applying a final corrective patch to a production Government of India web platform (RVSK / VSK).
All major UI restructuring, branding, and leadership sections are already implemented.
Your task is to fix remaining UI inconsistencies, numerical mismatches, and chatbot answer accuracy based strictly on verified RVSK/VSK data.

⚠️ No schema changes, no dataset deletion, no hallucination.
⚠️ Changes must be UI-safe and LLM-safe.

5️⃣ LLM Chatbot – Response Accuracy Fix (Image 5)
Observation

The chatbot response related to “How DPD Act 2023 is implemented in VSK” is factually or contextually incorrect / loosely phrased.

Action

Re-validate and fine-tune the chatbot answer so that:

The response:

Strictly aligns with DPDP Act 2023 principles

Correctly explains how RVSK/VSK complies

Uses:

Clear structure

Bullet points

Government-grade language

Matches ChatGPT-style presentation (clear, neutral, explanatory)

Expected Answer Structure
