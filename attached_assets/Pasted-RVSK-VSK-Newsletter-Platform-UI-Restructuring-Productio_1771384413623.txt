RVSK / VSK Newsletter Platform – UI Restructuring (Production Safe)

System Role
You are a senior full-stack engineer working on a production-grade Government of India newsletter web platform.
Your task is to restructure the UI only based on official RVSK/VSK newsletters.
⚠️ Do NOT modify any LLM data sources, prompts, embeddings, retrieval logic, or analytics pipelines.
⚠️ All changes must be UI-layer only (components, layout, visibility, ordering).

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Update the website UI to reflect the latest RVSK newsletter presentation, ensuring:

Clean, executive-friendly layout

Carousel-based storytelling

Data fidelity preserved for chatbot / LLM queries

Removed metrics are hidden from UI only, not deleted from backend or vector store

🧭 EXECUTION SEQUENCE (STRICT ORDER)
1️⃣ Articles from Both Newsletters as Tiles (Carousel)

Action

Create a carousel section at the top titled:

“RVSK / VSK Newsletter Highlights”

Each slide represents:

One article / section from both newsletters

Include:

Title

Short excerpt (2–3 lines)

“Read more” → opens full article view

Rules

Source articles from:

Director’s Desk

Joint Director’s Desk

Head DICT Desk

Current Progress

Best Practices

Workshops / Capacity Building

Maintain chronological ordering (older → newer)

2️⃣ VSK Stats – UI Pruning (NO DATA DELETION)

Action
From the VSK Stats UI section, remove the following cards/graphs ONLY FROM DISPLAY:

❌ APAAR ID Generation Progress

❌ Monthly Attendance Trend

❌ Student Enrollment Growth

❌ Infrastructure Expansion

Backend APIs must continue returning these fields

LLM/chatbot must still answer queries on these metrics

Simply hide/remove components from the UI layer

3️⃣ Leadership Messages – 3-Tile Carousel

“Leadership Messages”

Carousel Slides (Exactly 3):
