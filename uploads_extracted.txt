DPDP 2023: A COMPLIANCE ROADMAP e=u==
FOR VIDYA SAMIKSHA KENDRAS

With the enactment of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP)
Act 2023, the landscape of educational data management in India
has entered a new era of accountability. For Vidya Samiksha
Kendras (VSKs), which handle vast volumes of student and
teacher data, compliance is not merely a legal requirement but a
foundational pillar of trust.

The Rashtriya Vidya Samiksha Kendra (RVSK) has already initiated
several strategic measures to align national educational datasets
with these new privacy standards. Below is a high-priority checklist
for State and UT education authorities to ensure their VSK
operations remain compliant and secure.

The DPDP Compliance Checklist

1.Data Governance & Nomenclature Alignment
a.Standardization: States must ensure that school and location names in the UDISE+ database
strictly align with the Local Goverment Directory (LGD) nomenclature of the Ministry of
Panchayati Raj.
b.Correction Cycles: Authorities in 28 States and UTs have already been issued instructions to
rectify name mismatches to ensure uniformity across national datasets.
2.Technical Security & Auditing
a.Security Audit Certificates: It is mandatory for State VSKs to obtain and submit a valid Security
Audit Certificate to resume or continue data sharing with the national portal.
b.API Security: Data integration, particularly for attendance and assessment, must be conducted
via secure APIs. Support is currently being extended to states like Manipur and Meghalaya to
troubleshoot and secure these influx channels.
c.VPN Usage: Access to sensitive dashboards and backend data collation should be restricted
through Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect against unauthorized access,
3.Consent & Transparency
a.Revised Consent Forms: Consent remains a cornerstone of the DPDP Act. The Ministry is currently
considering revised Consent Forms to ensure that parent/guardian awareness is accurately
reflected before data processing.
b.Purpose Limitation: Data collected for initiatives like PM SHRI or NIPUN Bharat must be used strictly
for the educational outcomes intended.
4.The "6A" Frarmework Security
a.When managing the 6A Educational Data Framework, VSKs must apply privacy-by-design:
b.Attendance & Assessment Dota fields such as Class, Gender, and Social Category must be
handled with heightened sensitivity during pilot testing and national integration.
c.Read-Only Access; Granting “Read-Only Access” to programs/schemes data prevents
accidental modification and maintains the integrity of national monitoring.

As RVSK continues to act as a “force multiplier" for the Indian
education system, adhering to this checklist ensures that our
digital infrastructure remains interoperable, evolvable, and,
most importantly, responsible.

ETHICAL SAFEGUARDS FOR

USING Al IN MONITORING

As the Rashtriya Vidya Samiksha Kendra
(RVSK) moves toward integrating Artificial
Intelligence to enhance educational
governance, establishing robust data
safeguards is a non-negotiable prerequisite,
While Al offers transformative potential—such
as the Al Chatbot for Attendance —its
implementation must be grounded in the
principles of the National Digital Education
Architecture (NDEAR) and the DPDP Act 2023.

Core Safeguards for Al Integration

To ensure responsible and effective monitoring, the following safeguards must be

institutionalized across all VSK operations:

* Privacy by Design: integration with national platforms must utilize secure APIs and VPNs to
protect sensitive student and teacher data from unauthorized access.

* Data Accuracy and Standardization: Al-driven insights are only as reliable as the
underlying data. States must ensure strict alignment between UDISE+ and LGD
nomenclature to prevent algorithmic bias caused by inconsistent datasets.

* Purpose Limitation: Under the 6A Educational Data Framework, Al should be used strictly for
its intended educational outcomes, such as identifying early warning signs for student

dropout or personalizing learning pathways.

+ Transparency and Security Audits: Continuous monitoring through User Acceptance
Testing (UAT) and mandatory Security Audit Certificates ensures that Al systems remain

transparent and resilient against cyber threats.

Implementing these safeguards before full-
scale Al deployment ensures that the ‘force
multiplier” effect of RVSK leads to equitable
quality education. By prioritizing Responsible
Data Management, the Ministry of Education
can foster an environment where technology
empowers educators and protects the digital
identities of students and teachers.

Al Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA):
Short Checklist for Nodal Officers

Before launching new Al pilots, such as
attendance chatbots, State Nodal Officers
must verify these four pillars of data privacy:

6A Framework Alignment: Map pilots to

one or more core parameters:
Attendance, Assessment, Administration,
Accreditation, Adaptive Learning, or Al.
Data integrity: Strictly align all datasets
with UDISE+ and LGD nomenciature to
ensure consistency and prevent bias.
legal Compliance: Verify updated
parental/guardian consent and adhere to
the DPDP Act 2023 transparency
requirements.

Infrastructure Security: Use secure
APis/VPNs for data influx and maintain a
current Security Audit Certificate.

INSTITUTIONALIZING VSK’S:
STEP-BY-STEP ROADMAP

Institutionalizing a Vidya Samiksha Kendra (VSK) is a transformative process that aligns state
education systems with the vision of NEP 2020. By establishing a national-level IT-based
monitoring system, RVSK enables aggregated data analysis to ensure universal access and

educational excellence.
A Step-by-Step Implementation Roadmap

Step Focus Area Key Objectives

1 Universal School
Onboarding

2 Reporting
Saturation

Administrative
Insights

Actionable
Governance

Step I: Comprehensive School Integration
The foundation of a robust VSK is the
integration of every school management
type. Official directives emphasize that all
school management systems must be
mapped to their respective State/UT VSKs to
provide a unified national view. This
federated approach ensures that data from
diverse sources is collated into a single,
reliable analytics center.

Step 3: Shared ‘Seeing’ for Administrators
Dashboards and analytic tools are the
primary vehicles for sharing information
with stakeholders at all levels—from
national and state authorities to district
functionaries. By providing access to these
“powerful dashboards,” RVSK ensures that
key developments and best practices are
celebrated and disseminated effectively.

Integrating all management types (Government, Aided, Private, and
Others) into the VSK and RVSK architecture.

Ensuring regular, high-frequency data submission across student and
teacher attendance, as well as academic performance.

Sharing findings regularly with education administrators through real-
time dashboards and comprehensive reports.

Utilizing data for evidence-based decisions and providing timely
interventions for systemic concerns and grievances.

Step 2: Strengthening Data Reporting
Institutionalization requires shifting from
sporadic data entry to a culture of regular
reporting. States are encouraged to provide
regular teacher and student attendance data
to maintain the vitality of the national
monitoring system. Compliance and status
reports are essential tools for ensuring data
alignment across all participating regions.

Step 4: Data-Driven Interventions and

Accountability
The ultimate goal of RVSK is to drive a
paradigm = shift toward data-driven

decision-making. This system brings greater
accountability and responsiveness into the
education system, allowing administrators
to address grievances and educational
gaps with precision. These real-time insights
serve as the foundation for meaningful
interventions and long-term reforms.

HOW DATA IS RE-IMAGINING cae

INDIA’S CLASSROOM

We are witnessing the death of the delayed
report and the birth of the real-time
classroom. For decades, managing India’s
vast school network relied on manual
registries that often arrived too late to
trigger meaningful change. The transition
toward the Vidya Samiksha Kendra (VSK)
model marks a fundamental shift from
static data collection to a visionary “data to
action” framework.

This is not a top-down mandate but a
sophisticated, three-tier architecture
designed for “last-mile” accountability. As
established in the Gujarat model, the
hierarchy flows from the State VSK
(strategic planning) to 33 District VSKs
(hand-holding and training) and down to
254 Block VSKs (real-time monitoring of
attendance and learning). By decentralizing
visibility, the progress of millions of students
is no longer a mystery, but a visible,
actionable metric for every educator.

The Ultimate Comeback: From Bottom 5 to
Top 5

The UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and
Daman and Diu (DNH & DD) provides a
powerful case study for the effectiveness of
“precision governance." In 2021, the territory's
National Achievement Survey (NAS)
rankings were languishing in the bottom five
nationally. By 2024, through a rigorous cycle
of OMR-based mock tests and student-level
performance monitoring, they achieved a
stunning turnaround.

“UT improved its NAS ranking from bottom 5
(2021) to top 5 nationally (2024) through
focused, data-informed interventions &
continuous monitoring and support.”

The territory moved from generic policies to a
granular analysis of learning gaps across
specific subjects and grades. This success
story proves that targeted data can empower
teachers to identify exactly where a student is
stumbling. By shifting the focus from
“teaching” to “learning outcomes,” DNH & DD
has set a national benchmark for rapid
education reform.

identifying a student who has already left
school is reactive; identifying a student before
they leave is the hallmark of predictive
governance. States like Gujarat, Odisha, and
Telangana are deploying Early Warning
Systems (EWS) that flag at-risk students
based on absenteeism, academic
performance, and socio-economic profiles.
This system ensures that a student's struggle
is visible long before it leads to a dropout.
Odisha's model features a strict escalation
ladder that turns data into immediate physical
intervention:

* 7 Days Continuous Absence: Flagged to the
Headmaster (HM) for immediate action.

« 15 Days Continuous Absence: Escalated to
the Block Education Officer (BEO).

* 30 Days Continuous Absence: Escalated to
the District Education Officer (DEO) for
high-level intervention.

The End of Proxy Attendance: Facial
Recognition at Scale

Digital attendance systems are creating a
“single source of truth” that eliminates the era
of proxy entries and zero-enroliment schools.
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have
implemented Facial Recognition Systems
(FRS), while Jammu & Kashmir utilizes a
chatbot-based model for high-fidelity
tracking. These tools are not just
administrative; they are receiving praise from
local school visitors for their transparency.

transfers, a teacher can instantly share their
verified credentials through _ Digilocker,
eliminating the need for physical document
verification.

2. Continuous Professional Davelopment (CPD)
Tracking

Under the RVSK framework, APAAR serves as a
digital ledger for all training sessions and
workshops. Every credit earned through
programs like NISHTHA or specialized Capacity
Building Workshops is automatically recorded
against the teacher's unique ID.

Use Case. A teacher can present a
comprehensive, real-time ‘skill profile” that
showcases their expertise in niche areas like Al
integration, 6A Framework management, or
vocational pedagogy.

3. Data-Driven Classroom Insights

By integrating with the RVSK Attendance
and Assessment Dashboards, APAAR
allows teachers to move away from
manual paperwork. Real-time feedback on
student performance enables teachers to
identify learning gaps and implement early
interventions precisely where they are
needed.

Use Case: A teacher can use the NIPUN
Assessment Dashboard to identify specific
students who require foundational literacy
support, backed by longitudinal data
integrated through the student-teacher ID
link.

4. Streamlined Administrative Integration

APAAR simplifies a teacher's day-to-day
administrative load by automating data
collation across national programs like PM
SHRI, PM POSHAN, and UDISE+. This allows
educators to spend less time on manual

reporting and more time on pedagogical
innovation.

Use Case: When reporting attendance via
the Al Chatbot, the system automatically
maps the data to the correct class and
school management type, ensuring
accuracy without multiple entries.

The generation of APAAR IDs for teachers is
a pivotal step in creating an education
system that is inclusive and equitable. By
institutionalizing this digital registry, the
Ministry of Education ensures that every
educator is supported by an evolvable
infrastructure that promotes transparency
and lifelong professional tracking.
